            <p id="studies2">The task was to create a multi-purpose facility in place of the current offices buildings located by the Ohatsu-Tenjin shrine, near Osaka station. I created a hotel for tourists visiting the shrine to secure a similar revenue to the pervious office buildings. I also designed a park which has a similar axis reminiscing of a Japanese style garden. </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="studies3">Through this project, I learned that a realistic balance between what the designer wants to create and what is demanded must be considered. Even though a multi-purpose facility was demanded, there was still the need to secure the same or a larger revenue and capacity rate. I learned that the designer does not always have the power to create anything they want.</p>

            <p id="studies4">Also, this was my first project utilizing Revit. In the short period I was given, I was able to learn a completely new tool. Before this project, I used AutoCAD, since it was more suited for homes and smaller facilities. In result, I learned the importance of choosing tools depending on the task, since Revit was a much more efficient option.</p>
