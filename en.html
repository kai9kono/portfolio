                    <p class="bio">I was born in Tokyo in 2003, and was raised in California from the age of 7 to 13. After returning, I entered Tokyo Gakugei University International Secondary School. After graduation, I left Tokyo to attend Kwansei Gakuin University in Hyogo. My hobbies are PC gaming and driving.</p>

                    <p class="bio">I have always been into creation, and sice I had experience in coding, I decided to major in architecture where I could utilize my skills fully. However, even during architectural design, I found myself fiddling with various softwares and programs, which led me to realize that I wanted to pursure in digital design. Specifically, I desire to pursure UI/UX design, since the field has much in common with architecture.</p>
