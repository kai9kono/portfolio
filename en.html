                    <p class="bio">I was born in Tokyo in 2003, and was raised in California from the age of 7 to 13. After returning, I entered Tokyo Gakugei University International Secondary School. After graduation, I left Tokyo to attend Kwansei Gakuin University in Hyogo. My hobbies are PC gaming and driving.</p>

                    <p class="bio">I have always been into creation, and sice I had experience in coding, I decided to major in architecture where I could utilize my skills fully. However, even during architectural design, I found myself fiddling with various softwares and programs, which led me to realize that I wanted to pursure in digital design. Specifically, I desire to pursure UI/UX design, since the field has much in common with architecture.</p>

I created a hotel for tourists visiting the shrine to secure a similar revenue to the pervious office buildings. I also designed a park which has a similar axis reminiscing of a Japanese style garden. </p>

Even though a multi-purpose facility was demanded, there was still the need to secure the same or a larger revenue and capacity rate. I learned that the designer does not always have the power to create anything they want.</p>

Before this project, I used AutoCAD, since it was more suited for homes and smaller facilities.
