                    <p id="studies-text">For a project in my 3rd year of architectural design class that prompts “Design a space in Nakazaki-cho, Osaka, which serves as both a residence and a place of social activities”, I designed “The Jagged House”. In a place like Nakazaki-cho, where several cultures and generations intertwine, I decided that a Japanese-modern home with a pottery atelier as a space for art activities was appropriate. Not only did I put effort into designing a cozy living space, but I also was particular on the Japanese-style porch and courtyard, as well as the unique roof design.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p id="studies-text">This particular project was the first one that I utilized Revit, a 3D modeling software. In the short span given, I was able to learn a completely new tool, which allowed me to realize my growth over the past design classes. With Revit, since detailed expressions of the materials are possible, I was able to efficiently work on not only designing the plan, but also the facade design of the building. As a result, I was able to finish the project more efficiently than previous projects. Therefore, I learned the importance of utilizing different tools depending on the purpose.</p>
